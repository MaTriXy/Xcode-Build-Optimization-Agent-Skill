description: Apply approved Xcode build optimization changes following best practices, then re-benchmark to verify improvement. Use when a developer has an approved optimization plan from xcode-build-orchestrator, wants to apply specific build fixes, needs help implementing build setting changes, script phase guards, source-level compilation fixes, or SPM restructuring that was recommended by an analysis skill.

# Xcode Build Fixer

Use this skill to implement approved build optimization changes and verify them with a benchmark.

## Core Rules

- Only apply changes that have explicit developer approval.
- Apply one logical fix at a time so changes are reviewable and reversible.
- Re-benchmark after applying changes to verify improvement.
- Report exactly what changed, which files were touched, and the measured delta.
- If a change produces no improvement or causes a regression, flag it immediately.

## Inputs

The fixer expects one of:

- An approved optimization plan at `.build-benchmark/optimization-plan.md` with checked approval boxes.
- An explicit developer instruction describing the fix to apply (e.g., "set `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` to `dwarf` for Debug").

When working from an optimization plan, read the approval checklist and implement only the checked items.

## Fix Categories

### Build Settings

Change `project.pbxproj` values to match the recommendations in [build-settings-best-practices.md](../../references/build-settings-best-practices.md).

Typical fixes:

- Set `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT = dwarf` for Debug
- Set `SWIFT_COMPILATION_MODE = singlefile` for Debug
- Enable `COMPILATION_CACHING = YES`
- Enable `EAGER_LINKING = YES` for Debug
- Align cross-target settings to eliminate module variants

When editing `project.pbxproj`, locate the correct `buildSettings` block by matching the target name and configuration name. Verify the change with `xcodebuild -showBuildSettings` after applying.

### Script Phases

Fix run script phases that waste time during incremental or debug builds.

Typical fixes:

- Add input and output file declarations so Xcode can skip unchanged scripts.
- Add configuration guards: `[[ "$CONFIGURATION" != "Release" ]] && exit 0` for release-only scripts.
- Move input/output lists into `.xcfilelist` files when the list is long.
- Enable `Based on dependency analysis` when inputs and outputs are declared.

### Source-Level Compilation Fixes

Apply code changes that reduce type-checker and compiler overhead. See [references/fix-patterns.md](references/fix-patterns.md) for before/after patterns.

Typical fixes:

- Add explicit type annotations to complex expressions.
- Break long chained or nested expressions into intermediate typed variables.
- Mark classes `final` when they are not subclassed.
- Tighten access control (`private`/`fileprivate`) for internal-only symbols.
- Extract monolithic SwiftUI `body` properties into smaller composed subviews.
- Replace deeply nested result-builder code with separate typed helpers.
- Add explicit return types to closures passed to generic functions.

### SPM Restructuring

Restructure Swift packages to improve build parallelism and reduce rebuild scope.

Typical fixes:

- Move shared types to a lower-layer module to eliminate circular or upward dependencies.
- Split oversized modules (200+ files) by feature area.
- Extract protocol definitions into lightweight interface modules.
- Remove unnecessary `@_exported import` usage.
- Align build options across targets that import the same packages to prevent module variant duplication.
- Pin branch-tracked dependencies to tagged versions or commit hashes for deterministic resolution.

Before applying version pin changes:

- Run `git ls-remote --tags <url>` to confirm tags exist. If the upstream has no tags, pin to a specific revision hash instead.
- Verify the pinned version resolves successfully with `xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies` before proceeding.

## Execution Workflow

1. Read the approved optimization plan or developer instruction.
2. For each approved item, identify the exact files and locations to change.
3. Apply the change.
4. Verify the change compiles: run a quick `xcodebuild build` to confirm no errors were introduced.
5. After all approved changes are applied, re-benchmark using the same inputs from the original baseline:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/benchmark_builds.py \
     --project App.xcodeproj \
     --scheme MyApp \
     --configuration Debug \
     --destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16" \
     --output-dir .build-benchmark
   ```
6. Compare post-change medians to the baseline and report deltas.

## Reporting

Lead with the wall-clock result in plain language:

> "Your clean build now takes X.Xs (was Y.Ys) -- Z.Zs faster."
> "Your incremental build now takes X.Xs (was Y.Ys) -- Z.Zs faster."

Then include:

- Post-change clean build wall-clock median
- Post-change incremental build wall-clock median
- Absolute and percentage wall-clock deltas for both
- Confidence notes if benchmark noise is high
- List of files modified per fix
- Any deviations from the original recommendation

If cumulative task metrics improved but wall-clock did not, say plainly: "Compiler workload decreased but build wait time did not improve. This is expected when Xcode runs these tasks in parallel with other equally long work."

If a fix produced no measurable wall-time improvement, note `No measurable wall-time improvement` and suggest whether to keep (e.g. for code quality) or revert.

For changes valuable for non-benchmark reasons (deterministic package resolution, branch-switch caching), label them: "No wait-time improvement expected from this change. The benefit is [deterministic builds / faster branch switching / reduced CI cost]."

Note: `COMPILATION_CACHING` improvements are captured by the **cached clean** benchmark phase, which the benchmark script runs automatically when it detects the setting. Cached clean builds measure clean build time with a warm compilation cache -- the realistic scenario for branch switching and pulling changes. Standard clean builds may show overhead from cache population; use the cached clean metric as the primary comparison for this setting.

## Escalation

If during implementation you discover issues outside this skill's scope:

- Project-level analysis gaps: hand off to [`xcode-project-analyzer`](../xcode-project-analyzer/SKILL.md)
- Compilation hotspot analysis: hand off to [`xcode-compilation-analyzer`](../xcode-compilation-analyzer/SKILL.md)
- Package graph issues: hand off to [`spm-build-analysis`](../spm-build-analysis/SKILL.md)
